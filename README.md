# Movie Recommendation System

-----

## Overview

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using Python and leveraging **Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML)** for personalized interactions. The system aims to provide tailored movie suggestions to users by analyzing their past viewing history and preferences. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that might rely solely on collaborative or content-based filtering, this project incorporates an AIML-powered conversational agent to understand user tastes and recommend new movies they are likely to enjoy.

## Features

  * **Personalized Recommendations:** Recommends movies based on your historical viewing data (movies watched, ratings, genres preferred).
  * **AIML Integration:** Uses AIML to enable a conversational interface, making the recommendation process more interactive and user-friendly. The AIML bot can ask questions about your preferences and interpret your responses to refine recommendations.
  * **User History Management:** Stores and utilizes user viewing history to continually improve recommendation accuracy.
  * **Python-based:** Developed entirely in Python, utilizing its powerful libraries for data processing and AI.

## How It Works

The system operates in a few key steps:

1.  **User Interaction (AIML):** The AIML bot initiates a conversation with the user, potentially asking about their recent watches, favorite genres, actors, or directors.
2.  **History Analysis:** Based on the user's explicit input (from the AIML conversation) and their stored viewing history, the system analyzes patterns and preferences. This could involve techniques like:
      * **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommending movies with similar attributes (genre, cast, director) to those the user has enjoyed.
      * **Collaborative Filtering:** Identifying users with similar tastes and recommending movies they liked.
3.  **Recommendation Generation:** The system processes the analyzed data to generate a list of new movie recommendations.
4.  **Presentation (AIML):** The AIML bot presents the recommendations to the user in an engaging and conversational manner.

## Installation

To get this project up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
    cd movie-recommendation-system
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The project relies on several Python libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    (You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file containing libraries like `python-aiml`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc., depending on your specific implementation.)

4.  **AIML Setup:**

      * Ensure you have your AIML files (`.aiml` and `.pyaiml` if compiled) in a designated directory (e.g., `aiml_data/`).
      * The Python script will need to load these AIML files.

5.  **Data Setup:**

      * You'll need a dataset of movies and, crucially, a way to store user viewing history. This could be a CSV, a simple database, or JSON files.
      * An example dataset like MovieLens (small or full) is a good starting point for movie data.

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the recommendation system:

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will then start the AIML conversational interface. You can interact with it by typing your responses.

**Example Interaction:**

```
AIML Bot: Hello! I'm your movie recommendation assistant. What kind of movies do you like?
You: I enjoy action and sci-fi movies. I recently watched "Dune" and "The Matrix".
AIML Bot: Great! Let me see what I can find for you based on that.
... (System processes and generates recommendations) ...
AIML Bot: Based on your preferences for action and sci-fi, and your enjoyment of "Dune" and "The Matrix", I recommend "Blade Runner 2049" and "Inception". Have you seen those?
```
